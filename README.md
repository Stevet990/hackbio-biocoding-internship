# A brief explanation of my project.
The project is a practice on data types: including storing, organizing, and accessing information.
It's a Python code used to create a dictionary(dict)
Think of (dict) as a collection of key-value pairs; it allows one to store and retrieve data efficiently.
Unlike lists or tuples, dictionaries use keys instead of index numbers to access the values
Here in this project is the data of my HACKBIO_THREONINE  group members including the leader and every other members
